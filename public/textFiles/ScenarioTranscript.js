      You are on your first shift about 8am in the morning patrolling in your
      car in what is a hot spot area for crime. There is a huge problem with
      drugs, county lines and gangs, and there is credible intel that the older
      drug dealers are recruiting young school boys to carry their drugs for
      them in exchange for money, trainers, food, protection etc. You are
      driving around an estate and notice a young boy running franticly as if he
      is chasing someone. The boy notices you in your police car and has no
      change of behaviour or indication that he feels that he is doing something
      wrong. You circle the block and when you return to the same spot you
      notice him speaking to two older boys. His demeanour presents as not
      wanting to engage with the older boys, but he understands that he is in a
      compromising situation, soon enough you see him leave and rush off alone.
      Approximately 50 mins later you are patrolling but on foot a couple of
      miles from where you were earlier, and notice the same boy, but this time
      in uniform, looking very flustered and arguably neglected in a rush,
      walking considerably fast. You now have to make a decision if you should
      stop him and why, and what grounds you will try to establish in order for
      you to warrant a search.
