            The founder of I.E.T. (immersive empathy training) Kebbah has 20+
            years of youth work experience in and around the borough of
            Wandsworth, coupled with a shared lived experience of some of the
            young people classed as 'hard to reach'. In his current role, the
            young people and Kebbah have come up with an innovative training
            idea aimed at student Police in the form of a virtual reality 360Â°
            immersive experience, that puts the learner in the shoes of young
            people who face a number of challenges.

            <li>Unconscious bias</li>

            <li>Awareness of mental health challenges</li>

            I.E.T. (immersive empathy training) is unique as it leverages
            technology to simulate a lived experience of a community member
            (teenage black boy), and puts the learner in his shoes, insisting
            that the learner makes decisions in a short-high-pressured time. The
            content for this training has been informed by focus groups with a
            number of young people and student Police, who have expressed their
            key challenges with regard to Police and community relations, in
            particular stop and search.
