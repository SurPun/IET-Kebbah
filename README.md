##  Quick Introduction

We are building an Immersive Empathy Training programme for trainee police officers. Our programme will guild the user through a course using a series of questions and videos to bring awareness to their potential unconscious bias.

## Testing

We used the Javascript end-to-end testing framework, Cypress.

To run the tests;

- `npm run build`
- `npm run start`
- `npm run cypress`
